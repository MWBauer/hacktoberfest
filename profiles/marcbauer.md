Name: Marc Bauer
Location: Tennessee, USA
Education: I've been playing with and learning computers since the 1980's with the Commodore Vic20. Now I'm trying to learn
            more programming.
Projects: I am creating an app that helps indecisive people to create a meal prep plan for 1 meal or 1 day. 
Interests: Working out so that I can eat and drink the things that I like, hunting/hiking, and learning new languages both digital
            and spoken
Progress: I've started with FreeCodeCamp and worked thru a book on JavaScript for Programmers. I've also had many conversations
          with people about all kinds of tech/languages trying to learn more.
